<h1>Original Song</h1>
<h2>For 6th Grade Advisory by Victor Veytsman</h2>
<p>
This is an original song I made for Advisory.
</p>
<h3>Origins</h3>
<p>
This song started when I got a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_VL-1">Casio VL-1 VL Tone</a> 80s piano that is also a claculator,<br>
and influenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wafV1Jj3WtM">8-bit-keys's video<a> about it decided to make a multi-track recording<br>
of an original song.
</p>
<h3>The Song</h3>
<p>
When I got to advisory and we all got computers I sat down and started to work. I already knew the software that I was going to use, <a href="http://www.flat.io">Flat</a>,<br>
from previous expiriences so I sat down and got to work. I had made the song and then I had blah blah blah finish you later bye
